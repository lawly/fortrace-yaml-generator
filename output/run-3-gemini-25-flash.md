```
Title: The Encrypted Key: Data Exfiltration Attempt
Suspect: Elias Thorne
External: Maya Singh
Innocent users: Arthur Jenkins
Plot: Elias Thorne, an employee with a keen interest in cybersecurity and privacy tools, orchestrates a plan to exfiltrate confidential company data for personal financial gain. He copies sensitive project files from an internal network share to his local workstation. To conceal his actions, Elias creates a VeraCrypt container, encrypts the stolen data within it, and then generates a small, encrypted key file designed to unlock the full container. He composes an email to his external contact, Maya Singh, attaching this encrypted key file and sending it. Immediately after sending, Elias attempts to erase his digital footprint by securely deleting the VeraCrypt container, the original confidential files, and clearing the sent email from his client. He also browses cybersecurity forums and tries to clear system event logs and other forensic artifacts. Elias's critical mistake is that despite his efforts to securely delete files and clear logs, traces of the email composition, the attached key file in temporary email client directories, and his browser history detailing searches for encryption and anti-forensic methods remain discoverable, leading investigators directly to his illicit activities.
